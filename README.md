# Risk-Analysis-and-Predictive-Modeling-JMP-Pro
This project is a detailed Cybersecurity Analytics study that investigates the financial and operational predictors of corporate data breaches. Utilizing advanced statistical methods such as linear and logistic regression, the analysis evaluates how variables like total liabilities, stockholder equity, and employee count correlate with a company’s probability of being breached. By processing these datasets through JMP, the project identifies key risk factors such as the high susceptibility of the communication service sector while documenting the technical workflow of cleaning, filtering, and modeling data to assess predictive accuracy.
